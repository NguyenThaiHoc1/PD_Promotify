Starter Tutorial
================
You can also check out the full documentation here. Here is a starter example for using `Promptify <installation.rst>`_. Make sure you've followed the installation steps first.

Quick Tour
----------
To immediately use a LLM model for your NLP task, we provide the Prompter API.

.. code-block:: python
    
    from promptify import OpenAI
    from promptify import Prompter

    sentence = "The patient is a 93-year-old female with a medical history of chronic right hip pain, osteoporosis, hypertension, depression, and chronic atrial fibrillation admitted for evaluation and management of severe nausea and vomiting and urinary tract infection"

    model = OpenAI(api_key) # or `HubModel()` for Huggingface-based inference
    nlp_prompter = Prompter(model)

    result = nlp_prompter.fit('ner.jinja',
                            domain='medical',
                            text_input=sentence,
                            labels=None)


.. note:: 
    The `labels` parameter is optional. If you don't provide it, the model will automatically infer the labels from the text input. If you do provide it, the model will use the labels you provide.
    The output should be similar to the following:

.. code-block:: python

    [{'E': '93-year-old', 'T': 'Age'},
    {'E': 'chronic right hip pain', 'T': 'Medical Condition'},
    {'E': 'osteoporosis', 'T': 'Medical Condition'},
    {'E': 'hypertension', 'T': 'Medical Condition'},
    {'E': 'depression', 'T': 'Medical Condition'},
    {'E': 'chronic atrial fibrillation', 'T': 'Medical Condition'},
    {'E': 'severe nausea and vomiting', 'T': 'Symptom'},
    {'E': 'urinary tract infection', 'T': 'Medical Condition'},
    {'Branch': 'Internal Medicine', 'Group': 'Geriatrics'}]


Features
--------
- Perform NLP tasks (such as NER and classification) in just 2 lines of code, with no training data required
- Easily add one shot, two shot, or few shot examples to the prompt
- Output always provided as a Python object (e.g. list, dictionary) for easy parsing and filtering
- Custom examples and samples can be easily added to the prompt
- Run inference on any model stored on the Huggingface Hub (see notebook guide)
- Optimized prompts to reduce OpenAI token costs (coming soon)
